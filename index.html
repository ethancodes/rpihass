		<em>There will be some introductory documentation here.</em>

	<p>
		We're building templates for 6 pages.
		These page templates are "responsive," meaning that the appearance we change based on width of the device, whether it's a massive desktop computer, a tablet, or a phone.
		We are building "mobile first," meaning that we're starting with the small sizes and laying out the basics of HTML structure and CSS elements.
		We're using <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/">320 and Up</a>.
		You should be familiar with HTML(5), CSS/LESS, and jQuery.
