	<h1>RPI HASS</h1>
		
	<p>
		We're building templates for 6 pages.
		These page templates are "responsive," meaning that the appearance we change based on width of the device, whether it's a massive desktop computer, a tablet, or a phone.
		We are building "mobile first," meaning that we're starting with the small sizes and laying out the basics of HTML structure and CSS elements.
		We're using <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/">320 and Up</a>.
		You should be familiar with HTML(5), CSS/LESS, and jQuery.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Fonts.</strong> We're using "Proxima Nova" and "Proxima Nova Soft." We're using <a href="http://www.typekit.com/">TypeKit</a> to display them, which is currently defined in less/typography.less.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Images.</strong> Most images have the class "circle." jQuery will add the necessary code to turn that image into a circle, assuming your browser supports those CSS3 features. Thumbnails displayed on the page should be square, though the jQuery will crop them if they are rectangular. Images may link to a larger, non-circular image.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Text styles.</strong> Headings 1 through 6 have been styled, and examples of usage appear on Academics and Bachelors pages. Note that the "highlight" class will handle a paragraph, span, or list item with the bolder, purple font.
